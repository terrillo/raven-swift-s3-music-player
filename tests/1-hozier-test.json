He released his debut EP, featuring the hit single \"Take Me to Church\", in 2013 and his second EP, From Eden, in 2014. His debut studio album, Hozier, was released in Ireland in September 2014 and globally in October 2014.\n\nHozier was born in Bray, the son of a local blues musician. He attended St. Gerard's School before he began studying music at Trinity College, Dublin, but dropped out midway through his first year to record demos for Universal Music. While at Trinity, he became involved with the Trinity Orchestra. He was a member of the chorale ensemble Anúna from 2007 to 2012, and appears as a soloist on their 2012 release Illumination singing \"La Chanson de Mardi Gras.\" He toured and sang with the group internationally including performances in Norway and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2013, Hozier released the EP Take Me to Church (also containing \"Like Real People Do\", \"Angel of Small Death and The Codeine Scene\" and a live version of \"Cherry Wine\"), with the title track becoming his breakthrough single after it went viral on YouTube. It reached number one on iTunes on 25 October 2013. Hozier followed up Take Me to Church with the new EP From Eden (also containing \"Work Song\", \"Arsonist's Lullabye\" and a live version of \"To Be Alone\"), and a number of festival tour dates and television appearances in the United States. Hozier released his self-titled album, Hozier on 19 September 2014. It featured five singles, including Take Me to Church, Work Song, and From Eden, which were hits on his earlier EPs. On December 5, 2014, it was announced that \"Take Me to Church\" was nominated at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards for Song of the Year in 2015.\n\nHe performed for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2014, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night with Seth Meyers.\n\nHe was nominated for a Grammy and he performed \"Take Me to Church\" with Annie Lennox at the 2015 Grammy Awards.\n\nHe then performed the single \"Take Me to Church\" at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nIn June 2015 he sang the recessional hymn at the funeral of Olivia Burke, a 21-year-old Irish J-1 visa student who was killed along with five others when an apartment balcony collapsed in Berkeley, California. The same month, he also played the Glastonbury Festival.\n\nOn 12 November 2015 he won the VH1 Artist of the Year based on fan votes.
